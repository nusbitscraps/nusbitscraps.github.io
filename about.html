<main class="tab-content active">
  <p>
    Bitscraps is a student-led interest group focused on electronics repair, hands-on learning, and sustainability. We believe in the idea of “repair before replace” and aim to equip students with practical skills that go beyond lectures and tutorials.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our weekly sessions are designed to teach essential technical skills such as soldering, debugging, circuit analysis, and fault diagnosis. Members work on real, broken electronics and learn by fixing them—building confidence through practical experience in a collaborative, low-pressure environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bitscraps is open to students from all faculties and backgrounds. Whether you are an experienced electronics hobbyist or a complete beginner with no prior exposure, you are welcome here. Curiosity and a willingness to learn matter more than prior knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through repair sessions, workshops, hackathons, and community initiatives, Bitscraps aims to reduce electronic waste while fostering a culture of practical problem-solving and peer learning.

Sign-ups open at the start of each semester.
